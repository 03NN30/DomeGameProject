# Deep

Deep is a Unity-based video game intended for a full dome projection environment. It is being developed as part of the project "Play In My Dome V" at Bauhaus University Weimar. 

### Requirements
Deep is a cooperative game for exactly three players. Each player has to to install a companion app on their Android phone. The game requires your phone to have both an accelerometer and a gyroscope. If you are not sure whether or not it fulfills the requirements, simply install the app and look out for any error messages in the main menu. The game will start once all three players have successfully connected to the main application. A compiled version of the companion app can be found [here](https://github.com/chillpert/unity-phone-controller/releases).

### Story
You and your teammates will explore a cave system using an advanced submarine. Your goal is to find the lost crew of a previous expedition and answers to what happened to them. However, the path is full of obstacles and a mysterious interfering signal will make staying in control of your submarine quite difficult. If you don't work well as a team you might not be able to find a way out.
